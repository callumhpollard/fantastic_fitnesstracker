## Front-end
Handlebars are used along side with CSS and JS to build a responsive, good looking app.
## Back-end
NodeJs, Express, MySQL, Cookies and sequilization are used to build a dynamic application.
## Usage

Finally, to be able to test your back end routes with Postman, Insomnia Core or similar application, run on your command line ( npm start ) to start your local server.
